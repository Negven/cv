                        <p class="projects__p">This web application serves as a teacher's grade book. I had the privilege of being involved in its development during my summer internship at the esteemed IT company TATL Group. This remarkable application empowers educators to embrace the digital era by transitioning to an electronic grade book system. Teachers can effortlessly input grades, while parents and students gain convenient access to their academic records. This progressive solution enables parents to stay closely engaged with their children's scholastic achievements. Guided by my mentor's expertise, I diligently tackled the tasks assigned by the esteemed Project Manager. I contributed significantly to the development of the grade book's functionality, as well as the creation of an administrative section that empowers the system administrator to effortlessly manage data pertaining to teachers, students, and parents. Furthermore, I took the initiative to develop a seamless program that seamlessly migrates data from Excel spreadsheets to a suitable JSON format, allowing Excel enthusiasts among the teaching staff to conveniently populate student information. Presently, an increasing number of schools in Ukraine, including those in Kyiv, have wholeheartedly embraced UnitedSchool, entrusting its transformative capabilities to enhance their educational journey.</p>

                        <p class="projects__p">As a junior front-end developer, I had the exciting opportunity to collaborate with ElvisConsulting, a leading creative consulting service. The project involved creating both desktop and mobile pages, which were meticulously designed in Figma to reflect the unique vision and branding of ElvisConsulting.

                            Working closely with the Creative Director, I translated their creative ideas and concepts into visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces. Each element of the pages was carefully crafted to ensure a seamless user experience, enabling effortless navigation and engagement.

                            The desktop and mobile pages were designed with responsiveness in mind, ensuring that they adapt flawlessly to various screen sizes and devices. This approach aimed to optimize the user experience for both desktop and mobile users, enhancing accessibility across different platforms.

                            I collaborated with the client to link the pages to various essential components, including hosting, corporate email, corporate calendar, and social media platforms. This integration ensured that visitors could easily connect with ElvisConsulting through multiple channels and stay up-to-date with their latest projects and announcements.

                            Throughout the project, I remained attentive to detail and diligently implemented feedback from the Creative Director and team members, contributing to the overall success of the endeavor. It was a rewarding experience to be part of such a dynamic and innovative team, and I am proud to have played a role in bringing their creative vision to life on the digital landscape.

                            The project with ElvisConsulting provided me with valuable hands-on experience in front-end development, honed my skills in Figma, and strengthened my ability to collaborate effectively with a diverse team of creative professionals. I am excited to continue growing as a front-end developer and to take on new challenges that come my way.</p>

                        <p class="projects__p">This is a project for learning the English language that my team and I developed during our course at RS School. Within our team, we had a Project Manager who efficiently assigned tasks from the very beginning, and an experienced mentor who provided invaluable guidance at crucial moments. The application boasts individual dictionaries for each English language level, spanning from A1 to C2. It also offers engaging mini-games that facilitate the learning process, alongside comprehensive statistics to monitor personal progress. Regular team meetings allowed us to discuss achievements and overcome challenges, culminating in weekly sprints that summarized our journey and highlighted important aspects for the subsequent week. Our task statuses were conveniently tracked using Trello. My specific contributions encompassed the development of the dictionary's full functionality, as well as the implementation of user registration and login features. In today's world, English language proficiency is an indispensable asset, making this project a valuable tool for individuals seeking self-improvement and personal growth</p>

Additionally, I included information on how to support the shelter if you are unable to adopt a pet. The website is designed to be mobile-friendly, ensuring it looks great on any device. This project can be adapted for any shelter, helping homeless animals find wonderful homes.</p>

                            For several years, I have been tutoring children in years 6-10, providing lessons in mathematics and programming. I assist them with their homework and explain complex topics. This is especially important now as many children are missing their lessons and falling behind due to the ongoing conflict. For those children who show an interest in front-end development, I teach them the basics of JS, HTML, and CSS. Typically, I have 2-3 pupils per week, with whom I spend several hours. However, there are times, particularly before exams, when the number of pupils increases.
